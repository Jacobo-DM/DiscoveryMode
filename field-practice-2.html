      <h1>Listening for Pulse in the Everyday</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        A short walking practice to notice the rhythms of your own body, your food, and the spaces you move through.

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This practice introduces <strong>pulse awareness</strong> in a simple, portable way. It can be
        done on a school campus, on the way home, or in any familiar environment. The goal is to
        link three kinds of pulse:
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Body pulse</strong> — breath, muscles, gut signals, nervous system.</li>
          <li><strong>Ecosystem pulse</strong> — plants, animals, sounds, and human systems around you.</li>
          <li><strong>Community pulse</strong> — how it feels to be with others here: tight, playful, flat, alive.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Before You Begin (2–3 minutes)</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">1. Ground</p>
        <p>
          Stand or sit with your feet on the ground. Let your shoulders relax. Notice three breaths:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On the first breath, notice where you feel tight or tired.</li>
          <li>On the second, notice your belly and gut area (no judgment, just data).</li>
          <li>On the third, notice your feet and the surface beneath you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          If you already know a few RageDance warmups, you can add a gentle shoulder roll or small
          circle of the elbows to wake up the lungs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">2. Quiet Check-In</p>
        <p>
          Silently ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“What is my energy like right now — low, medium, high, mixed?”</li>
          <li>“Where do I feel it most — head, chest, gut, legs?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          There are no wrong answers. This is not a mood ring. It’s a simple snapshot of your current pulse.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Walk (8–12 minutes)</h2>
      <p>
        Choose a short route: around the building, through a courtyard, down a hallway and back,
        or along a sidewalk loop. Move in pairs or small groups if you like, but keep voices low
        enough that you can still hear the environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 1 — Body Pulse (2–4 minutes)</h3>
      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">3. Match Your Steps to Your Breath</p>
        <p>
          As you walk, try:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inhale for 3–4 steps, exhale for 3–4 steps.</li>
          <li>Notice how your body responds — easier, harder, the same?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          If you feel dizzy or uncomfortable, relax the counting and just breathe normally.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Phase 2 — Ecosystem Pulse (3–4 minutes)</h3>
      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">4. Three Layers of Sound</p>
        <p>
          While walking, pause your conversation and listen for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Closest sounds (your own footsteps, clothing, breath).</li>
          <li>Middle sounds (other people, doors, traffic, leaves, birds).</li>
          <li>Far sounds (a distant siren, a train, a dog, construction, waves, wind).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          Ask: “Which sounds feel calm? Which feel sharp, jagged, or restless?” This is ecosystem pulse.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Phase 3 — Community Pulse (3–4 minutes)</h3>
      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">5. The Feel of Places</p>
        <p>
          As you pass through different spots (hallways, corners, open spaces, doorways), quietly
          rate each place in your head:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Green</strong> — I could relax here.</li>
          <li><strong>Yellow</strong> — I’d be alert or cautious here.</li>
          <li><strong>Red</strong> — I’d rather not stay here at all.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          You don’t have to explain why yet. Just notice which spaces feel nourishing, which feel
          neutral, and which feel draining.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reflection & Braiding the Threads (5–10 minutes)</h2>

      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">6. Quick Write or Partner Share</p>
        <p>
          Back at your starting place, choose one:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Solo write</strong> for 3–5 minutes about one moment in the walk when you clearly
            felt a change in pulse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Partner share</strong> for 2–3 minutes each: describe one “green” place and one
            “yellow/red” place and how your body felt there.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">7. Gut · Movement · Environment</p>
        <p>
          Use one or more of these prompts to connect the dots:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“If my gut could speak about today’s walk, what would it say?”</li>
          <li>“Where did my breath feel easiest? Where did it feel tight?”</li>
          <li>“Did any space feel heavy or overfull — a place where your breath didn’t move as easily?”</li>
          <li>“Did any space feel like a clearing — simple, open, easy to breathe in?”</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="box">
        <p class="step-title">8. Optional RageDance Micro-Reset</p>
        <p>
          End with 60–90 seconds of gentle movement (standing or seated):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slow circles of the shoulders and elbows, like tracing an infinity sign in the air.</li>
          <li>A small sway of the hips and knees to feel the ground under your feet.</li>
          <li>Three deeper breaths, with a quiet exhale and soft jaw.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          The point is not to “exercise” but to let your body say, “I’m here. I’m listening.”
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>For Future Rounds</h2>
      <p>
        You can repeat this practice on different days and notice how the pulse changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>On a day with very little sleep.</li>
        <li>After different kinds of meals (heavy, light, sugary, simple, homemade).</li>
        <li>When the weather changes or the campus feels unusually tense or joyful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, you may begin to recognize patterns: places that always feel green, habits that
        always lead to red, and small changes that bring more life back into the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the heart of DiscoveryMode: noticing, adjusting, and repairing pulse together.

# DiscoveryMode

*A garden for learning, listening, movement, and return.*

DiscoveryMode is a way of learning that begins with the body, the place, and the stories we carry.  
It is not a product, curriculum, or brand.  
It is a **commons practice**: a way to invite breath, movement, wonder, and critical seeing into everyday learning.

DiscoveryMode works through:
- movement and somatic grounding  
- ecological listening  
- curiosity-led inquiry  
- story, memory, and community  
- returning to what the world is already offering  

DiscoveryMode belongs to no single person.  
It is carried by those who practice it.

## The Feral Garden Ethic (DiscoveryMode)

DiscoveryMode grows like a **feral garden**.  
This means:

1. **Non-ownership**  
   No one can own, trademark, or privatize DiscoveryMode.  
   It stays open-source, shareable, remixable.

2. **Wild Adaptation**  
   It changes by place, culture, language, community, season, and need.  
   There is no “official” version. There are only living versions.

3. **Play Over Performance**  
   Children, families, elders, teachers, neighbors—everyone contributes.  
   Skills matter, but play is sovereign.

4. **Mutual Stewardship**  
   Anyone may tend the garden.  
   No one may fence it.

5. **Regenerative Practice**  
   What is learned must strengthen community, land, and dignity—not extract from them.

## Core Principles

**1. Begin with the body.**  
Breath, posture, grounded awareness.

**2. Begin with the place.**  
Streets, gardens, hills, classrooms, stairwells—learning happens everywhere.

**3. Begin with the stories.**  
Family, ancestors, laughter, wounds, memory, imagination.

**4. Return.**  
To calm. To clarity. To each other.

## What DiscoveryMode is not
- not a monetized program  
- not a proprietary curriculum  
- not an “engagement system”  
- not a brand or identity  

It is a practice within the Flower Road Commons.

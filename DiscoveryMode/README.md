# DiscoveryMode  
*A garden for learning, listening, movement, and return.*

DiscoveryMode is a way of learning that begins with the body, the place, and the stories we carry.  
It is not a product, curriculum, or brand.  
It is a **commons practice**: a way to invite breath, movement, wonder, and critical seeing into everyday learning.

It lives alongside other Flower Road practices like **RageDance** and **Fox’s Anvil**.

## What DiscoveryMode Is

- A way of designing learning around **real bodies, real places, real questions**.  
- A set of **small, repeatable patterns** – RageDance cycles, Listening Walks, Story Stones, TurtleBack study, Field Altars, and more.  
- A **community-rooted practice** that adapts to context and culture rather than imposing a fixed method.  
- A way of protecting **agency, curiosity, and joy** in a time of collapse, noise, and institutional constraint.

## What DiscoveryMode Is Not

- Not an ed-tech platform, app, or scalable product.  
- Not a branded “method” or certification.  
- Not neutral: it stands with children, communities, and places treated as expendable.  
- Not a replacement for therapy, counseling, or medical care.

## Core Threads (v0)

DiscoveryMode rests on four interwoven threads:

### 1. Body  
Somatic grounding, breath, RageDance, movement patterns, safety from the inside out.

### 2. Place  
Gardens, streets, shorelines, kitchens, hallways, transit — the real geographies where learning lives.

### 3. Story  
Personal narrative, local histories, mythic structures, emergent fiction (for example, *Seven Nights in the Monster Kitchen*, *American Steel*).

### 4. Commons  
Practices shared openly, without extraction — remixable, non-commercial, free to evolve.

Every DiscoveryMode pattern touches at least two threads; many touch all four.

## The Garden Ethic (DiscoveryMode)

DiscoveryMode grows like a feral garden. That means:

- **No masters, no proprietary lineage.**  
  Guidance is possible; ownership is not.

- **Agency first.**  
  Anyone can adapt, refuse, reshape, or stop any practice.

- **Culture-forward.**  
  Local music, language, movement, and story are soil, not decoration.

- **Non-commercial.**  
  Materials live in the commons, not in markets.

- **Resistant to capture.**  
  If someone turns DiscoveryMode into a brand, franchise, or salvation product,  
  they have stepped out of DiscoveryMode.

Short version:

> **What grows freely resists capture. DiscoveryMode belongs where people remember how to listen.**

## What Exists So Far (v0 Map)

Right now, the clearest complete thread is:

### RageDance  
A small-space somatic discipline for carrying rage, fear, and grief with more steadiness.

- Repository: (see separate RageDance repo)  
- Status: **v0 live**  
- Materials include:
  - RageDance home page

Other threads (Listening Walks, TurtleBack, Fox’s Anvil, MythWear, etc.)  
are **in active development** and will be added slowly, with care.

## Invitation

DiscoveryMode is not a finished system.  
It’s a **path**, a set of **field notes**, and a permission:

> Start small.  
> Start where you are.  
> Begin with breath.  
> Share carefully with those who are ready.

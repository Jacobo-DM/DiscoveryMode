        <h2>What is the Elephant Circle?</h2>
        <p>
          The Elephant Circle is the DiscoveryPod’s core reflection ritual. After movement, trail time, story, or any significant moment, the Pod gathers to
          notice together what happened inside and around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is called the <strong>Elephant Circle</strong> because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>it holds a lot of memory</li>
          <li>it moves slowly enough for everyone to join</li>
          <li>it trusts that what seems small now may matter later</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          The Elephant Circle is not for judgment or evaluation. It is for noticing, wondering, and weaving different perceptions into a shared story.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <div class="section-label">1</div>
        <h2>The Outlier Gate</h2>
        <p>
          Two questions sit at the heart of every Elephant Circle. Together, they are known as the
          <strong>Outlier Gate</strong>:
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          “What did you notice outside our circle today?”  
          “What did you notice inside that we almost missed?”
        </p>
        <p>
          These questions invite:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>observations from the edges and margins</li>
          <li>memories from shy or quiet children</li>
          <li>details that escaped the group’s attention</li>
          <li>gentle disagreement about “what really happened”</li>
          <li>humor (“that wasn’t a raven, that was a very confused squirrel!”)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          The Outlier Gate protects the Pod from only hearing the loudest or most confident voices. It creates room for different truths to sit next to one another.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Hold an Elephant Circle</h2>
        <h3>Before the Circle</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Gather in a space where everyone can see each other’s faces.</li>
          <li>Invite children to bring their Weather cards, if you are using the Deck.</li>
          <li>Set a simple rhythm of arrival: sit, breathe, notice your body.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Opening</h3>
        <p>Facilitator or child host might say:</p>
        <p class="inline-note">
          “This is our Elephant Circle. We are here to notice together.  
          No one has to share. Listening also counts as being here.”
        </p>

        <h3>Asking the Questions</h3>
        <p>Invite responses to the two Outlier Gate questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="question">“What did you notice outside our circle today?”</span></li>
          <li><span class="question">“What did you notice inside that we almost missed?”</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Children can respond with words, gestures, pointing, sounds, or by holding up a Weather card.
        </p>

        <h3>Listening Rules (Simple and Gentle)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>one person speaks or shows at a time</li>
          <li>no interrupting; questions wait until after they finish</li>
          <li>no “you’re wrong” &mdash; instead: “I saw it differently” or “my body felt something else”</li>
          <li>laughter is allowed, but never at a person’s expense</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">

        <h2>Weather Deck + Elephant Circle</h2>
        <p>
          The Living Weather Deck and the Elephant Circle support each other. A child may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>hold up their Weather card while sharing what they noticed</li>
          <li>change their card during or after the circle, as their understanding shifts</li>
          <li>point to someone else’s card and say, “That’s how the moment felt to me”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          Over time, the Pod starts to recognize patterns: certain kinds of days may lead to similar weather patterns, or reveal surprising differences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <div class="section-label">4</div>
        <h2>Humor, Disagreement, and Repair</h2>
        <p>
          In a healthy Elephant Circle, humor and disagreement are not dangers – they are tools.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Humor</strong> can soften tension: playful reframing or small jokes about “mischievous weather” help keep the circle from becoming too rigid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disagreement</strong> is framed as curiosity: “I saw it differently,” “My memory is not the same,” “Can both be true?”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repair</strong> is always possible: if someone feels hurt, the circle can slow down, breathe, and try again.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          The goal is not to decide whose perception is correct. The goal is to learn how many ways a moment can feel inside different bodies.
        </p>

        <h2>RageDance &amp; the Elephant Circle</h2>
        <p>
          RageDance and the Elephant Circle are closely linked. Movement opens awareness; the circle names it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After a RageDance warmup, children may notice heat, tremble, calm, or openness and bring those sensations into the circle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Children can describe a moment in movement, then add words later if they wish.
          </li>
          <li>
            The facilitator might ask: <em>“Where did you feel that in your body?”</em> or
            <em>“Did your weather change during the movement?”</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          Movement first, understanding later. The circle is where patterns are gently named, not forced.

        <h2>Roles Within the Elephant Circle</h2>
        <p>
          Turtleback-style roles can help distribute responsibility in the circle:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time-keeper</strong> &mdash; notices when the circle needs to close or take a break.</li>
          <li><strong>Gate-opener</strong> &mdash; asks the two Outlier Gate questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Weather-keeper</strong> &mdash; helps place cards in the center if invited.</li>
          <li><strong>Soft-bell or Chime Keeper</strong> &mdash; signals the beginning and end with a sound.</li>
          <li><strong>Comfort-keeper</strong> &mdash; keeps an eye on blankets, cushions, or objects that help the group settle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          Roles are invitations, not assignments. Children may trade roles over time or sit without a role whenever they choose.
        </p>

        <h2>When Not to Use the Circle</h2>
        <p>
          There are moments when an Elephant Circle is not appropriate:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>when a child is in acute distress and needs one-on-one care</li>
          <li>when a situation involves privacy or safety outside the group’s scope</li>
          <li>when adults are not regulated enough to hold the space calmly</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-note">
          In those cases, a smaller, quieter form of listening is more suitable. The Elephant Circle works best when everyone has enough stability to listen and be heard.

        <h2>What the Elephant Circle Teaches Over Time</h2>
        <p>With steady practice, the Elephant Circle and Outlier Gate teach that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>many perceptions can be true at once</li>
          <li>quiet noticing is as valuable as speaking</li>
          <li>humor can protect relationships</li>
          <li>disagreement does not have to break connection</li>
          <li>the group is smarter than any one voice</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="footer-note">
          Over time, children begin to recognize themselves as part of a shared sensing system: “We are paying attention together.”

    <h1>Elephant Circle</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      A short circle to help you notice who is carrying something heavy today, without forcing anyone to speak
      before they’re ready.
    </p>
    <p class="tagline">
      “There’s an elephant in the room” is something many students feel but rarely say out loud.
      This practice lets you acknowledge that feeling in a gentle, practical way.
    </p>

      <h2>Purpose at a Glance</h2>
      <p class="meta">
        <span class="highlight">Time:</span> 8–15 minutes ·
        <span class="highlight">Group size:</span> any ·
        <span class="highlight">Materials:</span> none (optional: a small object to pass)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help the class notice the “weather” in the room without naming details.</li>
        <li>Give quiet students a way to be seen without pressure to explain.</li>
        <li>Offer a reset when the room feels tight, distracted, or “off.”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Story You Can Tell</h2>
      <p>
        You might say something like:
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        “Sometimes people say, ‘There’s an elephant in the room.’  
        They don’t mean a real elephant, of course. They mean there’s something big that everyone can feel,
        but no one quite knows how to talk about.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        We’re not going to name anyone’s elephants today.  
        Instead, we’re just going to do a quick ‘elephant circle’ to notice the weather in the room, and to
        remind each other that nobody has to carry heavy things alone.”
      </p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step · The Circle</h2>

      <h3>1. Set the frame (1–2 minutes)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Invite everyone to sit so they can see at least a few faces, not just the backs of heads.</li>
        <li>Say clearly: <span class="highlight">“You can pass at any time. No explanations needed.”</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Check the body first (2 minutes)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask students to place both feet on the floor (if possible) and rest their hands on their legs or desk.</li>
        <li>Invite one slow breath together: in… pause… out…</li>
        <li>You might say: <span class="note">“Just notice: are your shoulders tight or relaxed? Is your jaw clenched or soft?”</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The silent signal (3–6 minutes)</h3>
      <p>
        Choose <span class="highlight">one</span> of these options, depending on your group:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Thumb scale</strong>  
          “When it’s your turn, show with your thumb, without words:
          up, sideways, or down. Up means ‘I’m pretty light today.’  
          Sideways means ‘mixed weather.’  
          Down means ‘I’m carrying something heavy.’”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Three words</strong>  
          “When it’s your turn, you can share up to three words for your inner weather today.
          For example: ‘tired, hopeful, hungry.’ You can also just say ‘pass.’”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object pass</strong>  
          Hold a small object (stone, marker, eraser). The person holding it may:
          <ul>
            <li>say one word,</li>
            <li>say “pass,” or</li>
            <li>just hold it for a quiet breath and pass it on.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Move steadily but gently around the circle. You don’t need to comment on each person; just nod or say
        “thank you” as the signal moves.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Closing the circle (2–3 minutes)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask: “Based on what you saw, what kind of weather does our class have today?”  
          Invite two or three short answers.</li>
        <li>Say something like:
          <span class="note">
            “If your thumb was down or your word was heavy, you are welcome to talk to me after class or send me
            a message. You don’t have to, but you’re not invisible here.”
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>Finish with one more slow breath together and a simple transition line:  
          <span class="note">“Thank you for checking in. Let’s carry each other’s weather kindly as we move into the next part of class.”</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Variations & Adaptations</h2>
      <h3>For very young students</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use simple icons on the board: ☀️, ⛅️, 🌧.</li>
        <li>Students point to the symbol that matches their inner weather.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For older or restless groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Have students stand in a loose circle for the check-in, then return to seats.</li>
        <li>Use “step in, step out”: call simple statements like  
          “Step in if you are tired,”  
          “Step in if you are proud of something you did this week,”  
          then step back out. No one has to share details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For online or hybrid classes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use emojis or a quick poll for the “weather check.”</li>
        <li>Invite optional one-word check-ins in the chat.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Teacher Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are not promising to solve everything that comes up. You are promising to <em>see</em> it.</li>
        <li>If someone shows a very heavy signal (for example, head down, no response), you can check in later
            one-on-one or follow your school’s support protocols.</li>
        <li>Use Elephant Circle sparingly: it works best as an honest practice, not a daily ritual students learn to perform.</li>
        <li>You can connect this to academic work by noticing how “room weather” affects focus, discussion, or group work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        You don’t have to be perfect at this. The main work is letting students know:  
        <strong>“I’m paying attention to more than just your grades today.”</strong>
